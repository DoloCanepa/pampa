            <p>We are a team of farm consultants, recruiters, immigration advisers, and HR specialists who decided to address one of the most critical 
               problems of New Zealand businesses: the shortage of skilled workers.
               This is how Pampa International was born. A project oriented to connect New Zealand farmers with the best candidates for their businesses.
               Our work programme is focused on three key pillars: Training, Recruitment and Immigration Assistance.</p>
            
            
            <h3>We do this through a simple 5-step process :</h3>   
            <p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> We connect with skilled people from New Zealand and overseas who are interested in finding a job in a New Zealand farm. Our candidates have proven to be hard working, skilled and knowledgeable staff. They have historically settled successfully in New Zealand and can be assets to any New Zealand farm.</p>

            <p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Candidates will go through an intensive and tailored training program, in which we identify their strengths and weaknesses, and we provide them with the skills, techniques, and information that they need to succeed in the New Zealand farming industry.</p>
                
            <p><strong> Stage 3:</strong> We connect with New Zealand farmers, to understand their specific staff needs, and their organisational culture, so we can provide them with the best profiles for their businesses.</p>
                
            <p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> We take care of all the paperwork -job offer, employment agreement, job description, and the whole immigration process from end to end.</p> 
                
            <p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> We support candidates to settle into their new position and overall in New Zealand, through pastoral care and continuous support.</p>
            <h4>WE AIM FOR HAPPY FARMERS AND HAPPY STAFF.</h4>
