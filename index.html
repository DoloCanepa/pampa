    <div class="aboutus" id="nosotros">
        <p>We are a team of farm consultants, recruiters, immigration advisers, and HR specialists who decided to
            address one of the most critical
            problems of New Zealand businesses: the shortage of skilled workers.
            This is how Pampa International was born. A project oriented to connect New Zealand farmers with the best
            candidates for their businesses.
            Our work programme is focused on three key pillars: Training, Recruitment and Immigration Assistance.</p>


        <h3>We do this through a simple 5-step process :</h3>
        <p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> We connect with skilled people from New Zealand and overseas who are interested in
            finding a job in a New Zealand farm. Our candidates have proven to be hard working, skilled and
            knowledgeable staff. They have historically settled successfully in New Zealand and can be assets to any New
            Zealand farm.</p>

        <p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Candidates will go through an intensive and tailored training program, in which we
            identify their strengths and weaknesses, and we provide them with the skills, techniques, and information
            that they need to succeed in the New Zealand farming industry.</p>

        <p><strong> Stage 3:</strong> We connect with New Zealand farmers, to understand their specific staff needs, and
            their organisational culture, so we can provide them with the best profiles for their businesses.</p>

        <p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> We take care of all the paperwork -job offer, employment agreement, job
            description, and the whole immigration process from end to end.</p>

        <p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> We support candidates to settle into their new position and overall in New Zealand,
            through pastoral care and continuous support.</p>
        <h4>WE AIM FOR HAPPY FARMERS AND HAPPY STAFF.</h4>

            <h3>SERVICES</h3>
            <h4>Training</h4>
            <p>We connect the best skilled workers from overseas with our clients, and we understand that sometimes
                there are some differences between the way overseas and New Zealand farms work. This is the point where
                Pampa International is unique in the market as our applicants go through a complete training program
                before they arrive in New Zealand.
                Throughout this process we make sure they know exactly what to expect when starting the new position,
                their tasks and responsibilities.
                Also, we offer in-depth training in the key technical aspects of farming (pasture management, animal
                nutrition, milking process, and all the main aspects of the New Zealand farms).
                We aim to provide workers with all the necessary knowledge to progress and succeed in their farming
                career while offering competent and skilled staff to New Zealand employers.</p>
            <h4>Recruitment</h4>
            <p>Through adequate understanding of the farm’s culture and needs, we offer not only the best skills set
                match, but also a smooth transition of candidates into their workplace. We work with highly experienced
                New Zealand farm consultants and recruiters who can offer a unique insight and knowledge about New
                Zealand farming.

                All the candidates we recruit have to go through a complete training process before they start in their
                role. In this way, we can guarantee they understand the ¨Kiwi way¨ of farming before they start their
                jobs. Candidates receive training starting from simple terminology to more core complex techniques such
                as pasture management, milking process, animal needs and common mistakes to avoid.

                We focus on our applicants, helping them build their farming career from farm assistants to
                sharemilkers. When candidates or farmers contract our services, they become part of the Pampa community
                as we aim for long-term relationships.

                If for some reason the candidate does not fit into your farm’s system during the first 3 months, our
                engagement terms include a replacement guarantee.</p>
            <h4>Immigration assistance and advice </h4>
            <p>Under the current Accredited Employer Work Visa scheme, all New Zealand employers who wish to support
                migrant workers for a Work Visa must become accredited with Immigration New Zealand. The purpose of this
                policy is that only New Zealand viable businesses, with robust employment and immigration practices can
                hire migrant workers.

                Additionally, New Zealand employers must show they have made genuine attempts to hire
                New Zealand workers, and only recruit migrant workers where there are genuine
                shortages. This is made through a Job Check application before Immigration New Zealand.

                At Pampa International, we have competent and highly experienced Licensed Immigration
                Advisers that can guide, assist, and represent employers with the Employer Accreditation and Job Check
                applications.

                We also provide end-to-end immigration advice and assistance for candidates and their families. We can
                assist and represent them with their visa applications and with the long-term goal to gain residence in
                New Zealand.
